          <p>This is a list of partners that were recommended to us when we were planning for adoption. We know the decision process can be daunting, so we thought this might help you with your own journey!</p>
          <br>
          <p>I purposefully listed Amy at Connecting Hearts first as a home study should be your very first step on your Adoption Journey, whether you decide to work with attorneys, consultants, or agencies!</p>
          <br>
          <p>To help differentiate the partners, Connecting Hearts and other <span class="orange-reverse">Home Study partners have an orange border,</span><span class="yellow-reverse">Adoption Attorneys have a yellow border,</span><span class="green-reverse">Adoption Consultants have a green border,</span><span class="blue-reverse">Adoption Agencies have a blue border,</span><span class="purple-reverse"> and Adoption Resources have a purple border</span></p>
          <br>
          <p>What's the difference between attorneys, consultants, and agencies?<p>
          <br>
          <p><span class="yellow-reverse"><em>Adoption Attorneys</em> are professionals that take care of the legal side of adoption, like walking prospective birth parents through the consent paperwork and helping adoptive parents finalize their adoption in court, and will help you complete a successful adoption. Those listed on this page will also help match prospective parents with birth mothers.</span></p>
          <br>
          <p><span class="green-reverse"><em>Adoption Consultants</em> are experts who know the ins-and-outs of the process. They can help navigate the system, make the best possible decisions, and network with those who work with birth parents.</span></p>
          <br>
          <p><span class="blue-reverse"><em>Adoption Agencies</em> are the intermediaries in most adoptive journeys. Agencies facilitate adoptions and are in service of both birth parents and hopeful adoptive parents</span></p>
